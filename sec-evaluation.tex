\section{Evaluation}
I implement two automatic optimization tools, AutoMArch and AutoFAME, to demonstrate how a system of basic datapath specification combined with automatic optimization passes could work. The first tool AutoMArch automatically applies in order pipelining and multi-threading to a base functional datapath. The second tool AutoFAME automatically applies the FPGA emulation optimizations introduced in the \textit{A Case for FAME: FPGA Architecture Model Execution paper} \cite{FAME:2010} to a base functional datapath.
