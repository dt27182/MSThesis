\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, I created a tool that is capable of taking in a minimal FSM with no optimizations applied and generating a multi-threaded, pipelined design that is functionally equivalent to n copies of the input FSM, where n is the number of threads. The tool is capable of generating such designs for any specified number of threads, any number of pipeline stages, and any input FSM that follows reasonable IO restrictions. This allows the designer to specify the functionality of the design independently from optimizations to be applied to the design, which allows for much easier design space exploration as the designer keeps the same base design and simply specifies different multi-threading and pipelining options to apply to the design and lets the tool generate the optimized designs. I demonstrate this design space exploration capability by extensively exploring the design space of a example RISC processor without any manual specification beyond the base single stage, single threaded design.

In future work, I plan to extend the tool to work with Chisel instead of the reduced version of Chisel, which will allow for much more powerful front end HDL syntax to be used for the specification of the base design. I also hope to evaluate the delay/area/power efficiency of the automatically generated designs and improve the performance of the tool interms of logic generation efficiency.
