\begin{abstract}
Digital hardware frontend specification is defined by two extremes - RTL specification and HLS specification. RTL specification produces highly optimized designs, but requires extremely verbose low level specification on the part of the designer. On the other hand, HLS specification requires much less verbose high level specification from the designer, but does not produce well optimized designs. In this thesis, I present a middle ground that captures the pros of these two extremes - a system in which the designer specifies a basic datapath and uses a tool to automatically apply optimizations to that basic datapath.
